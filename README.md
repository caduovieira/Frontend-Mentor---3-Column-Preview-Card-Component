## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS3

### What I learned

Creating a hover state that scales up when the mouse goes over the button.
```css
.box button:hover {
    transform: scale(1.05);
    cursor: pointer;
    filter: brightness(115%);
    
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Reset CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me to reset all the pre-configured browser CSS settings. Obtained through the Tailwind's CSS output.
- [PowerToys](https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/powertoys/) - PowerToys was very useful for measuring all the elements of the original design provided by Frontend Mentor. I used the ScreenRuler tool.
